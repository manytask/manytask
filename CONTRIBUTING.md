## Git Commit Messages and PR description

This project uses light version of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). 
tl;dr

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests in commit body
* When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable tag:
    * `fix` - small bug fix
    * `docs` - docs changes 
    * `feat` - a new feature 
    * `chore` - changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies) 
    * `refactor` - code refactor that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    * `style` - changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
    * `perf` - changes that improve performance
    * `test` - including new or correcting previous tests
    * `ci` - continuous integration related

Good:
* `feat: create new api endpoint for student scores reporting`
* `perf: improve performance with lazy load implementation for images`
* `chore: update flask dependency to 2.1 version`

Bad:
* `some fixes`
* `oops`
* `fixed bug on landing page`
* `style changes and update`

Please, write the PR description following these guide and keep it updated as the PR evolves as we take this information as a final commit message when squash-merging into the main branch.

## Code review

Every commit goes through code review from one of the developers and we encourage you to review the pending PRs.

## Merging

To be merged, code should:
* Pass all checks
* Not have unresolved conversations
* Have at least one approval

We usually ask an author to merge their code so they can double-check that the commit message is up to date and describes the change well. Keep an eye on your PR and feel free to press the merge button when everything is ready.

## Python styleguide

All python code should follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and be typed.   
The code linted with `flake8` and `isort`, as well as type checked with `mypy`.
