# Production setup

There are some steps you need to tackle to whole system to operates
* `pre-setup` - one-time actions for repo and system setup (1 time for WHOLE manytask)
* `new course` - one-time actions for new course on manytask to operate 
* `new semester` - every-semester actions for each course to set up manytask

---

The setup for manytask in a nutshell looks as the following:

* self-hosted gitlab with students repo
* server with manytask instances (one for one course)
* *.manytask.org directing to server
* nginx-proxy resolving dns records to containers

for additional info and hints on the other infrastructure - see [checker docs](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/checker)

## Pre-setup

One-time actions necessary for the functioning of the entire repo/manytask system


### Docker

1. Create docker registry and user to push images  
   Currently `manytask` user at docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/u/manytask


2. Update image name in `.github` folder and docs to be ready to use it  
   Currently `manytask/manytask` image at docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/manytask/manytask


3. Set github secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` to use in github-actions


### Google

Actually, at some point manytask is a wrapper around google sheet (to store students scores, etc), so you need to use it 

1. Register new gmail(!) account for service purposes    
   or use existing one: `ysda.service.manytask@gmail.com` (credentials: @k4black)


2. Create New [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) Project for whole `manytask`
   * Crate new project  
     Or use existed one: `manytask` (credentials: @k4black)
   * [Enable Google Sheets API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/sheets.googleapis.com)
   * Give access for all admins to this project  

   For testing purposes:
   * Create [new service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials): `tester` with editor access.
     Note: Save private key (! it will apper only once) or create new if old is lost
     Or use existed one: `tester@manytask.iam.gserviceaccount.com`  
   
     
3. Create Testing Google Sheet and give access for the tester service account  
   Or use existing: [test sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cRah9NC5Nl7_NyzttC3Q5BtrnbdO6KyaG7gx5ZGusTM/edit?usp=sharing) with `tester@manytask.iam.gserviceaccount.com` access
   

4. Create github secret with Google credentials for testing   
   TODO


### Gitlab

Manytask currently operates only with self-hosted gitlab instance (to easily create accounts for users and use oauth)

1. Run self-hosted gitlab instance (separate server)  
   or use existing one:`gitlab.manytask.org` (more info: @slon)


2. Create admin (to create new users) gitlab account for manytask in [gitlab admin area -> users](https://gitlab.manytask.org/admin/users)  
   or use existing account: `ysda.service.manytask@gmail.com` or `manytask` (credentials: @k4black)


3. Create test gitlab oauth credentials in [gitlab admin area -> applications](https://gitlab.manytask.org/admin/applications/) with `api`, `sudo`, `profile` and `openid`  
   Or copy existed one (known by any gitlab admin: @k4black, @slon, @vadim_mazaev, etc.)  
   save it to `.env` file to future use


### General

1. Find Virtual Machine/Server to host manytask instances with public static ip 
   *2 core (2k MHz), 8 Gb RAM, 100 Gb disk - sufficient for ~100 students*
   * Install docker and docker-compose


2. Set dns record to point at statis ip  
   Use can use `manytask.org`, if you use manytask infrastructure    
   the easiest way is to set wildcard `*.manytask.org`  
   (can be done by dns admin: @slon)
   

3. Setup forwarding of `smth.manytask.org` to your manytask container and get ssl certs  
   the easiest way is to use [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) for auto-forwarding and auto ssl certs generation   
   check docker-compose example

## New course 

Actions you need to take one-time to run a new course with the `manytask`.
  
Note: If access to some accounts is lost, then you need to refer to the Pre-setup section above and create new.


### General

You may have your private manytask server. See `Pre-Setup -> General`

TL;DR: 

1. Setup server 
2. Setup dns record 
3. Setup docker forwarding and auto-ssl 


### Google

1. For the Google Cloud project (current: `ysda.service.manytask@gmail.com` account -> `manytask` project)  
   *Note: Alternatively you can create your own google project (other steps remain same; refer to pre-setup section).*

   * Create [new service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) unique for the course: `[course_name]` with editor access.   
     (for example: `python` - `python@manytask.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)  
     Note: Save private key (! it will apper only once) or create new if old is lost
   

2. Create google group with all your tutors to add all tutors as admins in one move  
   (for example `ysda-python-course@googlegroups.com`)


### Gitlab

1. Create new oauth application in [gitlab admin area -> applications](https://gitlab.manytask.org/admin/applications/), save `client_id` and `client_secret`  
   (can be done by any of gitlab admin: @k4black, @slon, @vadim_mazaev, etc.)


2. Create new gitlab api token (to create users and repos) for admin account `ysda.service.manytask@gmail.com`/`manytask` (credentials: @k4black)


3. Create a group for your course. Add all course admins/lecturers to the group as admins  
   (for example: [python](https://gitlab.manytask.org/python/))

   In the CI-CD settings:
     * Disable "Auto DevOps"
     * Enable Shared-runners


---


## New course semester

The following steps you need to take **each semester** (each new course with new students setting up).  


### Google 

1. Create Google Sheet and give access for the course service account created  
   * Create Public Google Sheet with rating/scores table, name it (for example `scores`):  
     For example: [test public sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cRah9NC5Nl7_NyzttC3Q5BtrnbdO6KyaG7gx5ZGusTM/edit?usp=sharing)  
     Naming example: `[YEAR] [fall-spring] - [course]` (example: `2022 spring - YSDA Python`)  
     (It's better to use service account from above steps to store it)
   * Remove all empty columns (manytask will create it automatically)
   * Share public table in reading only mode, save link for students
   * Give full access to all course admins/lectures (if you have Google group - just add the group) 
   * Give access to course service account you created (for example: `python@manytask.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
   

### Gitlab

You need to create a public repository with students assignments and group where students' repo will be stored.  
(Students' repos will be created by manytask automatically, but you should update `.env` file with repo and group names)


1. Create public (or internal) repository with course assignments (to fork students repo from)
   Naming example: `python/public-[YEAR]-[fall/spring]`  

   * In the CI-CD settings:
     * Disable "Public pipelines" to hide private tests logs
     * Enable "Auto-cancel redundant, pending pipelines"
     * Disable "Auto DevOps"
     * Enable "Shared runners"
     * Enable "Group runners"

     (This settings will be copied when student fork the repo via manytask) 
    
    
2. Create private(!) group for students of this semester (for students not to see repositories of each other)   
   Naming example: `python/students-[spring/fall]-[YEAR]`


### Manytask deploy 

Finally, (almost) you need manytask instance itself

You should use official docker image, available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/manytask/manytask)

Please refer to the [production documentation](./production.md)


### Testing script 

In the future, you need to create a testing script to test students' solutions and actually push scores obtained to the manytask instance.  
You have the following options:
* Use [yandexdataschool/checker](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/checker) - python lib developed for checking students' assignments and manytask integration
* Write your own script following manytask api

Please refer to the [yandexdataschool/checker documentation](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/checker) for further information and tips in both cases.
